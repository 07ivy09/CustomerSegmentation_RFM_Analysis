## 🧮 RFM Analysis Methodology

### Recency (R)
- Measures how recently a customer made a purchase  
- Lower recency indicates higher engagement

### Frequency (F)
- Measures how often a customer makes purchases  
- Higher frequency indicates loyalty

### Monetary (M)
- Measures total revenue generated by a customer  
- Higher monetary value indicates higher business impact

Customers are scored and grouped into actionable segments using business-defined thresholds.

## 💡 Key Business Insights

- A small percentage of customers (**Champions**) contribute a disproportionately high share of total revenue (Pareto effect)
- Customers with high historical frequency but poor recency indicate **early churn risk**
- Potential Loyalists present strong opportunities for targeted engagement
- Demographic factors such as age band and geography influence purchasing behavior
